# ClueChain - Word Guessing Game

A unique word guessing game where players reveal hidden words in paragraphs by solving clues which are progressively revealed.

## Architecture

The game follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Game State (`game-state.js`)

Manages the core game state with a nested structure:

```javascript
gameState = {
  current: {
    paragraph: null, // Current active paragraph
    chosenVowel: "", // Player's selected vowel
    words: [], // Hidden words with their states
    score: 0, // Current game score
    maxScore: 0, // Maximum possible score
  },
  config: {
    parameters: null, // Game rules and penalties
    paragraphs: null, // Available paragraphs
  },
};
```

State is accessed through getter/setter functions to maintain encapsulation:

- Getters: `getCurrentParagraph`, `getGameParameters`, `getAllParagraphs`, etc.
- Setters: `setCurrentParagraph`, `setGameParameters`, `setAllParagraphs`, etc.

### Game Controller (`game-controller.js`)

Handles game initialization and event management:

- `loadGameData()`: Loads game content and parameters
- `startGame()`: Initializes a new game session
- `setupGame()`: Sets up game UI and event listeners
- Event handlers for guesses and vowel selection

### UI Manager (`ui-manager.js`)

Manages all DOM interactions and UI updates:

- `renderParagraph()`: Displays masked paragraph text
- `renderClues()`: Shows word clues
- `updateScore()`: Updates score display
- `showGameOver()`: Displays end-game message

## Game Flow

1. `main.js` initializes the game on window load
2. Game data is loaded from JSON files
3. Player selects a vowel to reveal in hidden words
4. Player guesses words based on clues
5. Score updates based on correct/incorrect guesses
6. Game ends when all words are found

## Key Features

- Random paragraph selection
- Vowel-based word masking
- Points system with penalties
- Crossword-style clues
- Visual feedback for guesses
- End-game statistics

## Development Notes

- Uses ES6 modules for code organization
- State management through encapsulated functions
- DOM manipulation centralized in UI manager
- Asynchronous data loading with error handling
- Event-driven architecture for game interactions

## Game Parameters

The `game_parameters.json` file configures:

- Scoring system
- Penalties for wrong guesses
- Game rules and settings
