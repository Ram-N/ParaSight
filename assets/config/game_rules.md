## Quick Rules for First-Time Players

1. **Pick your starting letters:**  
    Choose **1 vowel and 2 consonants** at the start. These will appear wherever they occur in the paragraph.
    
2. **Start guessing words:**  
    There are **10 hidden words**. You can guess them in any order.
    
3. **Clues unlock progressively:**  
    Youâ€™ll start with **3 random clues and 3 word endings** shown.  
    After **every guess (right or wrong)**, **1 more clue** and **1 more ending** get revealed.
    
4. **Track remaining letters:**  
    The **Letter Marketplace** shows how many unrevealed instances of each letter remain across all hidden words.
    
5. **Scoring depends on clue level:**  
    Solving with harder clues gets you more points. Revealing a word costs points.
