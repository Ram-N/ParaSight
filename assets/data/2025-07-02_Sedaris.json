  "text": "Sometimes I think of it as a search for low-hanging fruit, even though I know that’s not quite the right simile–it’s something people walk by all the time, something so ingrained in our environment that it’s become invisible, something so obvious nobody sees it anymore, but then someone figures out how to say what it is, or how to see it, and everyone else says, “Of course! Why didn’t I say that? That’s exactly right. I always knew that was there,” or “That’s exactly how I feel.” Like when Bill Callahan sings, “Well, I can tell you about the river / Or we could just get in.”",
